--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(danceability) FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
    ORDER BY danceability DESC;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    LIMIT 10;
    
--What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    
--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT track_name, avg(danceability) FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
    GROUP BY track_name
    ORDER BY popularity DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    
--For every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, you need to show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”
With popularity_average_CTE AS(
    SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
    FROM Spotifydata s
    GROUP BY s.artist_name
    )
SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
