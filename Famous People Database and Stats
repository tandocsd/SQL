** This project was completed as a part of Khan Academy's Intro to SQL course. I created a two tables about actors, which included data about the celebrity's 
name, age and the characters they played. Additionally, I used a JOIN function to display information from both tables. At the end is a table combining multiple 
joins to id married couples.**

CREATE TABLE actors
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
    name TEXT, 
    age INTEGER);

INSERT INTO actors (name, age) VALUES
    ("Matthew Mercer", 40),

    ("Liam O'brian", 46),
    ("Talison Jaffe", 45),
    ("Marisha Ray", 33), 
    ("Sam Riegal", 45);

SELECT * FROM actors;

CREATE TABLE character
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    player_id INTEGER,
    character_name TEXT,
    campaign INTEGER);

INSERT INTO character (player_id, character_name, campaign) VALUES
